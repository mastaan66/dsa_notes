## Introduction to Data Structures And Algorithms
---
#### *Introduction*
***Algorithms:*** Methods for solving problems that are suited for computer implementation.

***Data Structures:*** Schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

***Performance:*** It is a central consideration in the study of algorithms

#### Algorithms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we write a computer program, we are generally implementing a *method* that has been devised previously to solve some problem.

This *method* is often

- Independent of the particular programming language being used.
- It is likely to be equally appropriate for many computers and many programming languages.
- It is the method, rather than the computer program itself, that speciÔ¨Åes the steps that we can
take to solve the problem.

#### Algorithm

The term *algorithm* is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

- DSA is the stuff of computer science: they are central objects of study in the field.
- The choice of the best algorithm for a particular task can be a complicated process, perhaps involving sophisticated mathematical analysis. The branch of computer science that comprises the study of such questions is called analysis of algorithms.
- We should not use an algorithm without having an idea of what resources it might consume, so we strive to be aware of how our algorithms might be expected to perform.

#### 1.1 BASIC PROGRAMMING MODEL

We refer to the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our programming model.
